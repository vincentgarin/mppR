\description{
Evaluation of MPP QTL detection procedure by cross-validation (CV).

\details{
For details on the MPP QTL detection models see \code{\link{mpp_SIM}}
documentation. The CV scheme is adapted from Utz et al. (2000) to the MPP
context. A single CV run works like that:

\enumerate{

\item{Generation of a k-fold partition of the data. The partition is done
within crosses. Each cross is divided into k subsets. Then for the kth
repetition, the kth subset is used as validation set, the rest goes into the
training set.}

\item{For the kth repetition, utilisation of the training set for cofactor
selection and multi-QTL model determination (\code{\link{mpp_SIM}} and
\code{\link{mpp_CIM}}). If \code{backward = TRUE}, the final list of QTLs is
tested simultaneously using a backward elimination
(\code{\link{mpp_back_elim}}).}

\item{Use the list of detected QTLs in the training set to calculate
the proportion of genetic variance explained by all detected QTLs in the
training set (p.ts = R2.ts/h2). Where R2.ts is the adjusted
R squared and h2 is the average within cross heritability (\code{her}). By
default, her = 1, which mean that

For each single QTL effect, difference partial R squared are also
calculated. Difference R squared are computed by doing the difference between
a model with all QTLs and a model without the ith position. For details about R
squared computation and adjustment look at \code{\link{QTL_R2}}.}

\item{Use the estimates of the QTL effects in the training set (B.ts) to
predict the phenotypic values of the validation set. y.pred.vs = X.vs*B.ts.
Computes the predicted R squared  in the validation set using the squared
Pearson correlation coefficient between the real values (y.vs) and the
predicted values (y.pred.vs). R2.vs = cor(y.ts,y.pred.ts)^2. Then
the predicted genetic variance in the validation set (p.vs) is equal to
p.vs = R2.vs/h2. For heritability correction, the user can provide a single
value for the average within cross heritability or a vector specifying each
within cross heritability. By default, \code{her = 1}, which means that the
results represent the proportion of phenotypic variance explained (predicted)
in the training (validation) sets.

The predicted R squared is computed per cross and then averaged
at the population level (p.ts). Both results are returned. Partial QTL
predicted R squared are also calculated using the difference between the
predicted R squared using all QTL and the predicted R squared without QTL i.
The bias between p.ts and p.vs is calculated as bias = 1 - (p.vs/p.ts).

\strong{WARNING!(1)} The computation of \code{mpp_CV()} function using mixed
models (all models with \code{VCOV} different than \code{"h.err"}) is
technically possible but can be irrealistic in practice due to a reduced
computer power. Since a mixed model is computed at each single position it
can take a lot of time. From our estimation it can take between 20 to 50
times more time than for the linear model (HRT).

\strong{WARNING!(2)} The computation of random pedigree models
(\code{VCOV = "pedigree" and "ped_cr.err"}) can sometimes fail. This could be
due to singularities due to a strong correlation between the QTL term(s) and 
the polygenic term. This situation can appear in the parental model. From
our experience, trying to re-run the function one or two times
allows generally to obtain a result.

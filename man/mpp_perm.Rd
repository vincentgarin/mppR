\usage{
mpp_perm(
  mppData,
  trait = 1,
  Q.eff = "cr",

  N = 1000,
  q.val = 0.95,

\arguments{
\item{mppData}{An object of class \code{mppData}.}

\item{trait}{\code{Numerical} or \code{character} indicator to specify which
trait of the \code{mppData} object should be used. Default = 1.}

\item{Q.eff}{\code{Character} expression indicating the assumption concerning
the QTL effects: 1) "cr" for cross-specific; 2) "par" for parental; 3) "anc"
for ancestral; 4) "biall" for a bi-allelic. For more details see
\code{\link{mpp_SIM}}. Default = "cr".}

\item{VCOV}{\code{Character} expression defining the type of variance
covariance structure used: 1) "h.err" for an homogeneous variance residual term
(HRT) linear model; 2) "h.err.as" for a HRT model fitted by REML using
\code{ASReml-R}; 3) "cr.err" for a cross-specific variance residual terms
(CSRT) model; 4) "pedigree" for a random pedigree term and HRT model;
and 5) "ped_cr.err" for random pedigree and CSRT model.
For more details see \code{\link{mpp_SIM}}. Default = "h.err".}

\item{N}{Number of permutations. Default = 1000.}

\item{q.val}{Single \code{numeric} valu or vector of desired quantiles from
the null distribution. Default = 0.95.}

\item{verbose}{\code{Logical} value indicating if progression of the function
should be printed. It will not affect the printing of the other functions
called by \code{mpp_perm()}, especially the printing of \code{asreml()}.
Default = TRUE.}

\item{n.cores}{\code{Numeric}. Specify here the number of cores you like to
use. Default = 1.}
}
\value{
Return:

\code{List} with the following object:

\item{max.pval }{Vector of the highest genome-wide -log10(p-values).}

\item{q.val }{Quantile values from the QTL significance threshold null
distribution.}

\item{seed}{\code{Numeric} vector of random generated seed values for each
permutation.}
}
\description{
Determination of an empirical null distribution of the QTL significance
threshold for a MPP QTL analysis using permutation test
(Churchill and Doerge, 1994).
}
\details{
Performs N permutations of the trait data and
computes each time a genome-wide QTL profile. For every run, it stores the
highest -log10(p-val). These values can be used to build a null distribution
for the QTL significance thershold. Quantile values can be determined from
the previous distribution. For more details about the different possible
models and their assumptions see \code{\link{mpp_SIM}} documentation.

\strong{WARNING!(1)} The computation of \code{mpp_perm()} function using mixed
models (all models with \code{VCOV} different than \code{"h.err"})
is technically possible but can be irrealistic in practice due to a reduced
computer power. Since a mixed model is computed at each single position it
can take a lot of time. From our estimation it can take between 20 to 50
times more time than for the linear model (HRT). We advice to compute
threshold with the HRT (linear) model and use it for the mixed model as well.

\strong{WARNING!(2)} The computation of random pedigree models
(\code{VCOV = "pedigree" and "ped_cr.err"}) can sometimes fail. This could be
due to singularities due to a strong correlation between the QTL term(s) and 
the polygenic term. This situation can appear in the parental model. From
our experience, trying to re-run the function one or two times
allows generally to obtain a result.
